# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

### New Features

- **Avalonia UI** - a second, cross-platform front end, `ReadyCode.Avalonia`, built on
  [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/). It shares all editor, tokenizer, assembler, diagnostics, and
  emulator logic with the Windows app through a new `ReadyCode.Core` library, so both produce
  byte-identical `.prg` output. Covers BASIC and assembly editing with PETSCII rendering, the folder
  explorer (including `.d64`/`.d81` browsing), find and replace, live diagnostics with a Problems
  panel, VICE transfer/run and machine controls, the BASIC debugger on VICE, and Preferences. The
  Windows app is unchanged. Currently released as a macOS binary; see
  [README-Avalonia.md](README-Avalonia.md) for platform support and what is and isn't ported yet

### Improvements

- **`ReadyCode.Core`** - the editor's non-UI logic (tokenizer, assembler and disassembler,
  diagnostics, minify/prettify, the diff engine, the BASIC debugger, and the VICE and C64 Ultimate
  clients) now lives in a `net8.0` class library the Windows application references, rather than
  inside the WPF project. Behavior is unchanged; the library and its tests build and run on Windows,
  macOS, and Linux, so that logic can be exercised without a Windows machine and shared with other
  front ends
- **Cross-platform CI** - a GitHub Actions workflow building and testing the shared library, the
  Avalonia UI, and both test suites on Ubuntu and macOS, and compile-checking the WPF app on both, so
  a change to the core can't silently break the Windows build

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `FacFloat.Encode` silently accepting `NaN` on ARM64 (Apple Silicon): casting `NaN` to `int`
  yields `0` there rather than `int.MinValue` as on x64, so the range check that was meant to reject
  it never fired. `NaN` and infinity are now rejected explicitly

## [v2.4.0] - 2026-09-11

### New Features

- **Per-tab Upper/Lower Case Mode** - toggle a BASIC tab's C64 keyboard emulation between the default "Upper Active" charset and "Upper Inactive" via `Edit > Lower Case Mode`, a new `Ctrl+Shift+L` shortcut, or by clicking the Shift Badge in the status bar; a new status bar Caps Lock indicator reflects, and can toggle, the real Windows Caps Lock state

### Improvements

- File Compare now allows comparing two files of different kinds (e.g. a `.bas` against a `.prg`), instead of requiring both sides to match
- The status bar's Lines indicator is now clickable

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a false "NEXT without a matching FOR" error for loop variable names 3 or more characters long
- Fixed the editor sometimes failing to auto-scroll to keep the caret in view

## [v2.3.2] - 2026-09-08

### New Features

- **File > New > BASIC File (.bas)** - a new menu item and `Ctrl+Shift+N` shortcut for creating a blank, untokenized `.bas` file directly, instead of having to Save As a `.prg` file and rename it. A new `.prg` file (`Ctrl+N`) now also renders with the C64 font and PETSCII glyph substitution from the moment it's created, and the Save dialog for a new `.bas` file now defaults to the `.bas` extension instead of always assuming `.prg`

### Improvements

- The About dialog now also shows the "Build" portion of the version number

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed PETSCII characters inserted from the side panel rendering in the wrong font (or not at all) - most noticeable after using Save As to turn a new file into a `.prg`, or after Reopen Closed Tab, both of which left the editor's font/PETSCII-substitution mode stuck on its previous setting
- Fixed a spurious "ghost text" autocomplete suggestion sometimes appearing after inserting a PETSCII character from the side panel
- Better aligned the current line's top/bottom highlight border with the caret, especially on an empty line

## [v2.3.0] - 2026-09-04

### New Features

- **Errors panel** - a new VS-style Errors tab alongside the existing Debug panel (Variables/Breakpoints/Call Stack), listing every current diagnostic across all open tabs with double-click-to-jump; toggled via a new `View > E_rrors Panel` menu item with persisted open/closed state. The BASIC tokenizer's previously-silent malformed-line drops now also surface as squiggles and Errors-tab rows instead of failing invisibly

### Improvements

- The File Compare tab's diff panes now follow the editor font size set in the Settings dialog instead of a fixed size
- Minor light theme color tweak to the PRG file-type badge
- Improved scroll-to-search-result accuracy and keyword/variable hover tooltip positioning/priority

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where code editor text would visually "bunch up"
- Fixed the Pi character (and other raw PETSCII bytes above `$7F`) getting corrupted during tokenizing

## [v2.2.0] - 2026-08-24

### New Features

- **BASIC Debugger** - full line-level debugging for BASIC programs against both VICE and a C64 Ultimate: breakpoints (gutter click, F9 to toggle, Ctrl+F9 to enable/disable, Ctrl+Shift+F9 to delete all), Step Into/Over/Out, Pause/Continue, Run to Cursor, a live Call Stack panel (VICE only - the C64 Ultimate's REST API has no CPU register access), and a live Variables panel showing every simple variable's current value
- **Live variable editing** - double-click a variable's value in the Variables panel to edit it in place and write the new value straight back to the running VICE or C64 Ultimate session; a string value's PETSCII control codes (cursor movement, color, reverse video) render with their real C64 glyphs, matching the code editor's font, so they're visible and preservable rather than silently lost when editing a string that has them
- **File Compare** - a side-by-side or unified diff view for any two comparable files (`.bas`, `.asm`/`.s`, or `.prg` - a BASIC `.prg` is detokenized and a machine-language one disassembled, the same as opening it directly would show), with an "Ignore Whitespace" toggle and a whole-document change-location strip for quick navigation to the next difference

### Improvements

- The Find bar no longer re-searches the whole document on every keystroke while typing nearby with it open - the search is debounced, and match highlights now track live edits via AvalonEdit's own text anchors instead of drifting onto the wrong text as the document changes

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `SPC(`/`TAB(` tokenizing with a doubled opening parenthesis when the file was loaded on real hardware or VICE, since those two BASIC tokens bake the parenthesis into the token itself rather than treating it as a separate character
- Fixed a `.prg` file with a few bytes of trailing disk-sector padding past its own end-of-program marker being misclassified as machine language instead of BASIC, opening it in the hex viewer instead of the editor

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### New Features

- **Disassembler** - turns 6502 machine code back into address-annotated assembly text in a read-only tab. **Disassemble at...** (now available for both C64U and VICE, previously C64U only) reads live memory from a running C64 Ultimate or VICE instance; **Disassemble file** does the same for a machine-language `.prg`/`.ml` file in either Explorer tree, automatically detecting and skipping a BASIC loader stub so disassembly starts at the real code
- **Load/Run from the file tree** - right-click a `.prg`, `.asm`/`.s`, or machine-language file directly in either Explorer tree for Load ▸ / Run ▸ submenus that send it straight to the C64 Ultimate or VICE without opening it first
- **Drag-and-drop overhaul** - full support in the C64U Explorer tree (previously local-only), dragging a file onto a `.d64`/`.d81` disk image now embeds it directly (assembling `.asm`/`.s` or tokenizing `.bas` along the way), and dragging in from Windows Explorer is now target-aware: drop onto a folder to copy/upload, onto a disk image to embed, or anywhere else to open as new tabs
- Standalone assembly programs (an explicit `.org`, or Assembler Output set to Standalone) now auto-start correctly when run on VICE, matching the C64 Ultimate's existing behavior, by typing a `SYS` command into the keyboard buffer after loading
- **[RFC] BASIC Module System** - a draft spec for splitting a BASIC program across multiple files is up for community feedback; see the README and [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/jbramwell/READYCode/issues/1)

### Improvements

- Context menus across both Explorer trees standardized: consistent "Open in BASIC/Assembly/Hex editor" wording, "Disassemble file" placement, repositioned "Reveal in File Explorer" and "Add File...", and "Download to PC..." renamed for clarity
- "Add File to Disk Image" now correctly assembles `.asm`/`.s` source before embedding it, instead of writing the raw, unassembled text
- Linting, ghost-text completion, and keyword completion are now disabled for read-only disassembly tabs
- Disassembly toolbar polish: improved focus behavior, tab title, button styling, and height-clipping fixes
- Disassembler address fields are now forced to uppercase
- Assembler performance improvements for large source files
- Symbols panel reorganized for assembly files
- Editor tab tooltip now shows the full file path, with a new Copy Path context-menu item
- `.bas` files are no longer tokenized under any circumstance, keeping them byte-for-byte plain PETSCII text
- Expanded documentation for the Disassembler, drag-and-drop, and Assembly editor addressing-mode behavior

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed VICE's Run command not auto-starting programs with an explicit origin (`* = $c000`)
- Fixed a 6502 assembler bug where an absolute-mode operand with a value under 256 written as a 4-digit hex literal (e.g. `$00F0`) was silently narrowed to zero-page addressing, corrupting instruction length and later branch offsets
- Fixed BASIC-loader-stub detection failing on real-world stubs with non-canonical link pointers or no trailing end-of-program marker, so Load/Run and Disassemble file couldn't find the true machine-code origin in some existing files
- Fixed empty `.prg` files being misclassified as machine language, and a crash when opening or restoring them
- Fixed a UTF-8 byte-order mark in `.asm`/`.s` files causing spurious "Unknown mnemonic" errors when loading or running from the file tree
- Fixed dragging a file onto a disk image showing a blocked-drop cursor and refusing to embed it
- Fixed the disassembly view's gutter showing sequential line numbers instead of real memory addresses

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-07-26

### New Features

- **6502 Assembly support** - a full assembly-language editor mode alongside BASIC: mnemonic, label, and directive highlighting, a built-in two-pass assembler covering all 56 official 6502 opcodes and addressing modes, `.org`/`.byte`/`.text`/`.word` directives, inline diagnostics, a Symbols panel, hover tooltips, and an ASM Mnemonics reference panel
- **Hex Editor** - open any file as a raw offset/hex/ASCII grid, with inline byte editing, click-drag selection, and its own undo/redo history
- **.d81 disk image support** - both Explorers can now browse, create, and author `.d81` (1581) disk images in addition to `.d64`
- **Find in Files / Replace in Files** - project-wide search and replace across `.bas`, `.asm`, `.s`, `.txt`, and `.prg` files, with match case, whole word, and regular expression options, and a results tree grouped by file
- **BASIC keyword shortcuts** - recognizes the real C64 keyboard abbreviations for around fifty BASIC keywords (an unshifted letter or two followed by a shifted letter), plus PRINT's `?` shorthand, honored by tokenizing, syntax highlighting, hover tooltips, and GOTO/GOSUB navigation
- **Online documentation** - a full documentation site covering every major feature now lives in [`/docs`](docs/README.md), linked from the README and from Help > View Online Docs

### Improvements

- Minify's line renumbering now starts at line 0 instead of line 1 (thanks for the tip, @jim_64s8-bitprojects)
- Prettify, Minify, and hover tooltips all recognize BASIC keyword shortcuts consistently, so a line using a shortcut like `Da` for `DATA` gets the same treatment as the full keyword

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the PETSCII Reference pane inserting the wrong character for PETSCII codes in the graphics block (96-126), among a few others
- Fixed assembly-file comments rendering as PETSCII graphics instead of plain text, a regression from the PETSCII fix above
- Fixed Prettify not adding spaces around mathematical and logical operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `<`, `>`, `<>`, `<=`, `>=`), while correctly leaving a negating `-` unspaced
- Fixed `REM` comments gaining an extra space every time a file was saved and reopened

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### New Features

- **Variables window** - new panel showing all variables declared in the current program
- **Static analysis (linting)** - red squiggles flag syntax errors inline before you transfer to the C64U or VICE
- **Code folding** - collapse REM blocks and FOR/NEXT loops to reduce visual noise in longer programs
- **Renumber** - renumbers line numbers across the entire program, automatically updating all GOTO and GOSUB references (Code menu)
- **Go to line from GOTO/GOSUB** - Press F12 on a line number reference to jump directly to that line
- **Reopen closed tab** (Ctrl+Shift+T) - tab history tracks recently closed files so you can reopen them
- **Restore tabs on startup** - previously open files are automatically restored when READYCode launches
- **Drag-and-drop** - drag .prg files from Windows Explorer directly onto READYCode to open them
- **Ctrl+Tab / Shift+Ctrl+Tab** - cycle forward and backward through open editor tabs
- **Tooltips for keywords and variables** - hover over any keyword or variable to see a description
- **Tooltips for special characters** - hover over PETSCII special characters to see their name and PETSCII value
- **Function keys in Quick Keys pane** - F1-F8 key mappings now appear in the Quick Keys panel
- **File > Close Folder** - new menu item to close the current folder

### Improvements

- Syntax highlighting now covers string literals and numeric literals in addition to keywords
- Improved Commodore 64 color theme accuracy
- Tokenized byte count is now displayed in the status bar when saving a file
- BASIC keyword descriptions updated to be clearer and more descriptive
- Code prettify spacing corrected around operators and keywords
- Context menus cleaned up; added option to bring VICE Emulator to the foreground
- Keyboard shortcuts for Transfer and Run commands remapped for consistency

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Minify incorrectly stripping values from DATA statements (thanks for the tip, @johnginno5671)
- Fixed line number auto-increment generating numbers between existing lines when pressing Enter mid-program
