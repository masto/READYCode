/// A live BASIC line-level debug session against a real C64 Ultimate, implemented entirely
/// through its REST API (no native breakpoint/memory-watch capability exists there, unlike
/// VICE's binary monitor) by injecting <see cref="C64UDebugStub"/> into the running machine and
/// polling its status byte every 250ms - see the debugger spec's C64 Ultimate section and
/// <see cref="C64UDebugStub"/>'s own remarks for the stub's design.
///
/// Every enabled breakpoint is pushed to the stub's own breakpoint table (up to
/// <see cref="C64UDebugStub.MaxBreakpoints"/> of them - the stub checks each one on every GONE
/// call) whenever the set changes, so - unlike an earlier version of this session, which tracked
/// only a single active line and had to guess which one to re-arm after each hit - every enabled
/// breakpoint stays watched simultaneously, the same as VICE's independent per-breakpoint
/// checkpoints. Breakpoints beyond the table's capacity simply aren't armed on the device; this
/// session doesn't warn about that today.
